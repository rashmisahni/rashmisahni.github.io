## About Me 

I lead marketing efforts at Velos, Inc.  As a member of the Consulting Services group, I manage multiple projects and over customer relations at leading academic institutions and hospitals. 

Specializing in English literature and communications, I hold a PhD from Columbia University in New York. I have over 8 years of experience in conducting research, teaching, training, and using technology at research institutions such as Columbia University and University of Delhi. 

Having published and edited several articles for peer-reviewed literary and health-tech journals, I now author or review all Velos marketing content for web, print, and multimedia.
